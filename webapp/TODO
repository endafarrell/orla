* Getting Endomondo: done
* Get the direct messages for endafarrell_med: done
* Save to disk _all_ the uploaded files
* Separate the uploading of from the processing of the uploaded files
* Find a decent way of "drawing" the results
* Get the comments in the endomondo results
* Cleanup the SmartPix API uploader servlet code (you can't read a stream twice :-( )
* The comments in an Enodmondo run are _not_ stored with the run. They _are_ available on the profile page but have to
  be stitched together to the runs later :-/
* When re-loading the SmartPix, state the overlap point.
* There are loads of dupes in the db. Find out why. Stop that happening again. Remove them/rebuild the lot.
* Add a time-range to the getEvents code.
* Add numRows, changes, timestamp feed (from monitor) to the UI as a visual reminder of what's there.
* No longer Endomondo - time to use the other one.
* Need to manually add the last few runs to the DB
